Backend Developer Evaluation System - Project Report

PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project implements a comprehensive backend service that automates the initial screening of job applications using AI-powered evaluation. The system evaluates candidate CVs and project reports against specific job requirements and case study briefs.

ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN
System Components:
1. RESTful API Server (Hono Framework)
2. Document Processing Pipeline
3. Vector Database (ChromaDB) for RAG Implementation
4. LLM Evaluation Pipeline with Chaining
5. Job Queue System (Bull + Redis) for async processing
6. Error Handling & Resilience Mechanisms

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

1. Backend Service Architecture
- Framework: Hono (Node.js) with TypeScript
- API Endpoints: /health, /upload, /evaluate, /status/{jobId}, /jobs
- Middleware: CORS, logging, Swagger documentation
- Production deployment with PM2 and Nginx reverse proxy

2. Document Processing & RAG Implementation
- PDF/text file upload and processing
- Text chunking with overlapping segments (800 chars, 200 overlap)
- ChromaDB integration for vector storage and retrieval
- Embedding generation using Google Gemini API
- Context retrieval for both CVs and reference documents

3. LLM Chaining Pipeline
CV Evaluation Chain:
- Input: CV content + Job requirements + Scoring criteria
- Process: Technical skills assessment, experience evaluation, achievements analysis
- Output: Structured scores (1-5) with detailed reasoning

Project Evaluation Chain:
- Input: Project report + Case study requirements + Technical criteria
- Process: Correctness verification, code quality assessment, resilience testing
- Output: Comprehensive evaluation with creativity score

4. Job Queue & Async Processing
- Bull queue with Redis backend for job persistence
- Configurable concurrency limits (3 simultaneous evaluations)
- Automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Progress tracking and status updates
- Job completion callbacks with result storage

5. Error Handling & Resilience
- Comprehensive error handling for AI API failures
- Circuit breaker patterns for external service calls
- Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
- Input validation and sanitization
- Retry mechanisms with configurable limits

API DESIGN & ENDPOINTS

POST /upload
- Accepts CV and Project Report PDFs
- Validates file formats (PDF only for production)
- Processes documents through text extraction and chunking
- Stores in vector database with metadata
- Returns document IDs for evaluation

POST /evaluate
- Triggers evaluation pipeline for uploaded documents
- Accepts job title, CV ID, and project report ID
- Queues job for async processing
- Returns job ID for status tracking

GET /status/{jobId}
- Retrieves current job status and progress
- Returns complete evaluation results when completed
- Includes detailed scoring breakdowns and summary

GET /jobs
- Lists all evaluation jobs (debugging endpoint)
- Shows job status, progress, and timestamps
- Supports pagination and filtering
